This project uses YOLO-NAS for accurate ship detection in satellite images. Integrated with a Django web app, it enables image upload, real-time detection, bounding boxes, and ship counts. Compared with YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, YOLO-NAS shows better accuracy and speed, supporting maritime monitoring applications.
